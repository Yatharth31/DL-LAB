GAN pits two model together hence, advesarial.
Generative Advesarial Network.

GAN is an example of unsupervised learning. It consist of two sub model 
1. Generator
Create fake samples. 
Generator take and loops over many samples to create images, so that it can fool a discriminator or a human. 

2. Discriminator
Take a given sample and figure out if its real or fake.


Example : 

Loser has to update their model. 
Generator and discriminator are implemented as CNN. 

Real usage is : Figuring out next frames in a video, Image enhancement.


Minimise 2 losses -> 2 optimizer
Uses Binary cross entropy loss
